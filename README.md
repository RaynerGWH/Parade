# 🎭 Parade Card Game (G2T5)

*"Channeling the wonder and whimsy of nerdy CS minds to bring you a strategy game where luck collides with logic, and minds duel — one parade at a time!*

Our Java project brings the captivating card game **"Parade"** onto a virtual console playground! This game is about understanding **when to risk it**, **when to hold back**, and **when to sacrifice**. It's not simply about showing off beautiful colors. We delved deeply into card game logic, score computation, and dynamic user interface creation while working on this project. Our task? to create a captivating digital experience that captures Parade's vibrant charm and ingenious surprises.
