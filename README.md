## ▶️ Playing Parade

Prerequisites: 
💡 You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to compile and run the game.

**NOTE:** The game is playable on any device, but for the best experience, we recommend running it on a unix shell.

Also, use `Ctrl +` or `Ctrl -` to zoom in or out and center the Parade display for a more balanced and immersive game display.


1. Compile the Java Code:

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the below compile script:

```bash
compile.bat # For Windows
compile.sh # For MacOS and Linux
```
2. Run the Game:

In the same terminal window, run the start script:

```bash
run.bat # For Windows
run.sh #For MacOS and Linux
```

Source code
