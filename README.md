Programming in Java, our project provides the popular card game "Parade" in a polished virtual console playground!

Parade play prioritizes predicting when to push forward, when to pause, and when to pay penalties. Perfecting not just pretty patterns, we pondered over precise card game logic, point calculations, and polished console UIs while producing this project.
