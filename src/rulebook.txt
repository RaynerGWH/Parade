           PARADE RULEBOOK (COMPRESSED)
==================================================

Objective:
  Score the fewest points by avoiding parade cards.

Components:
  • 66 cards (6 colors, values 0–10)
  • 1 score pad

Setup:
  • Shuffle the deck.
  • Deal 5 cards to each player.
  • Place 6 cards face-up to form the initial parade.

Gameplay:
  • On your turn, play one card to the parade.

River & Removal:
  • Cards beyond the played card’s value form the "river".
  • The river enters removal mode.
  • Remove cards from the river that match the played card’s color or have a value ≤ its value.
  • Special: Playing a 0 triggers removal for all parade cards.

Turn Sequence:
  1. Play a card.
  2. Process the river: remove cards as needed.
  3. Draw a card.

Game End:
  • Occurs when a player collects all 6 colors or when the draw pile is exhausted.
  • Final Round: Every player plays one last turn without drawing.

Scoring:
  • For each color, majority cards score 1 point each plus the printed values.
  • Winner: The player with the lowest total score wins.
  • Two-Player Rule: Majority requires 2+ cards more than the opponent.
  • Note: Cards remaining in the parade at game end are discarded.
